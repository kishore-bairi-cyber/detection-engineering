# Detection Engineering Repository

This repository contains **production-style detection use cases** designed for real-world Security Operations Center (SOC) workflows.  
Each detection is documented with background, simulated logs, SPL/KQL/LogRhythm queries, triage reports, and alert templates.

## ✅ Completed Use Cases
| MITRE ID | Technique Name              | Status   |
|----------|-----------------------------|----------|
| T1059    | Command Execution           | ✅ Added |

## 🛠 How to Use
1. **Pick a use case folder** (e.g., `T1059_Command_Execution`).
2. Review `background.md` for:
   - MITRE ATT&CK mapping
   - Hypothesis
   - Simulation steps
3. Load `simulated_log.log` into your lab SIEM or search head.
4. Paste `detection_spl.txt` into your SIEM (Splunk, Sentinel, LogRhythm, etc.).
5. Validate detection with test data.
6. Use `triage_report.md` to document investigations.
7. Deploy `alert_template.json` for continuous monitoring.

## 📌 Conventions
- **MITRE IDs** in folder names for quick mapping.
- **5W+1H** triage report format for consistency.
- Queries tagged with `# Objective` and `# Data Source` comments.
- Use meaningful commit messages (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`).
